# feign-example

This is a sample project to show how Feign(a declarative HTTP client developed by Netflix) can be used for api testing. 
Feign is simplifying HTTP API clients and is elegant because developers only have to declare and annotate an interface while the actual implementation will be provisioned at runtime.</br>

The following RESTful API was used for demo purposes: <a>https://petstore.swagger.io/</a></br>
Models were generated from JSON with the help of the: <a>http://www.jsonschema2pojo.org/</a></br>
